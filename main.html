	<h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time Complexity of an algorithm/code is not equal to the actual time required to execute a particular code, but the number of times a statement executes. We can prove this by using Time complexity, efficient the time command. </p>
	<p>A lot of students get confused while understanding the concept of time complexity, but in this article, we will Space Complexity, O(n) explain it with a very simple example.</p>
	<p>Make sure to include exactly two paragraphs with appropriate h1 and b tags as described above. Follow the given structure and content to ensure Space Complexity your solution aligns with the requirements.</p>
